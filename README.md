The Simple Hotel Management System is a VB.NET project that can help manage the hotel's Guest Room Check-in/Check-out and Reservation. This system stores the list of Client, Hotel Rooms, Reserved Rooms and etc. The system automatically calculates the payable amount of the guest after selecting the room and check-in/check-out date range. The system also calculates the minimum advance payment/down payment amount. However, we are yet to fully complete it
The Simple Hotel Management System project uses SQL Database
